# Haikyou Demo Project

This project is a little demo using React and redux(managing state) for the front end and a Rails API for managing and persisting data.

As a user, you can visit the single page application, and 'navigate' routes to view haikus posted by others and also create your own haiku and share it with the users community.

Right now, only the ability to create and post haikus is functional


# Backend Database
This app currently runs with a rails API I created to display and manipulate data. Here is the repo for the API:

https://github.com/wizbeck21/haikyou-api

# Before running the application
Make sure to use npm install or yarn install before starting the server to install any missing dependencies.

Also make sure to have a database linked, either the rails API I built or create your own to match the application and change the fetch endpoints to your specific database.

# Work in progress

This is by no means a finished project. It is a minimum viable product to get the main idea of the app functional.
